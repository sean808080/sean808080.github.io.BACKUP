Who:
-  a young lady who lived across 30th street

What:
- being a NY apartment, our windows faced a wall of windows and it became a past time to observe what the neighbors were doing.  this particular young lady was transfixed most times I watched her. She would spend an inordinate amount of time staring at herself in a make up mirror.  Now I think of Narcissus but at the time I figured she was an insecure young actress.

When:
-  late 1990's

Why?:
- Sociological or voyeuristic implications aside, living in NYC meant people pursued different paths to enjoying their leisure time.

Where:
- E. 30th street in NYC
